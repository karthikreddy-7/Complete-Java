## Java OOPs Concepts
In this section, you will find Java code examples that illustrate fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

<!-- Add code examples or links to files in the repository -->

## Sorting and Searching
This section covers various sorting and searching algorithms implemented in Java. You'll find examples of popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc., as well as searching algorithms like Binary Search.

## Linked Lists
Linked lists are fundamental data structures in computer science. In this section, you will find Java implementations of singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists along with relevant operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

## Stacks
This section contains Java implementations of stacks, a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Examples of stack operations like push, pop, peek, and isEmpty will be provided here.

## Queues
Queues are another essential linear data structure. In this section, you will find Java implementations of queues with the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) behavior. Operations like enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isEmpty will be included.

## Trees
Trees are hierarchical data structures with a root node and subtrees. This section covers Java implementations of binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, and other tree-based algorithms and operations.

## Graphs
Graphs are versatile data structures that represent relationships between objects. In this section, you will find Java implementations of graph representations (adjacency matrix, adjacency list) and algorithms like breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS).
